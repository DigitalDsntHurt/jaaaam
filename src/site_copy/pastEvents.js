                    Feeling good in our bodies is a learnable skill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Feel Good is a space to practice deep listening — to ourselves, to others, to the larger and smaller universes of this moment. Sometimes we need to sweat and lose our breath to feel good. Other times we are called to roll around the floor or simply lie still.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through guided and improvisational movement, somatic modalities, contact and non-contact partnering, body work and play we will become craftspeople of our own bodies: attuning and responding to what we find.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Come together and practice feeling good.

                    Healthy Holidays offers a fun and playful set of physical and relational practices to help folks prepare to thrive (not just survive) through the holiday season. Through explorations of physical movements, physical and attentional games and safe, respectful and gentle touch, we will practice resourcing and regulating ourselves and our loved ones.
