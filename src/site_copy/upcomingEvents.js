                    Join The Center SF for a playful evening of contact improvisation. Class will be from 7:30-9pm and then will flow directly into a jam until 10:30pm. In class, weâ€™ll explore themes of weight-sharing, counterbalancing, signaling, listening, and everything in-between. The jam that follows is an opportunity to continue researching your movement & relational curiosities that sparked from class. First-timers and experienced dancers are all very welcome!
