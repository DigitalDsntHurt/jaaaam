                    In this class, we treat movement fluidity as a learnable skill and explore how we can move efficiently, safely and beautifully over the course of a long life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fluid movement can help us learn faster, exert less, prevent and recover from injury, have more fun and impress our friends.{' '}
                    We will learn what fluid, efficient movement is and how to practice it by studying four structural elements:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <li>Our relationship with the ground and with gravity</li>
                    <li>A balanced pelvis</li>
                    <li>An available spine</li>
                    <li>A floating head</li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    There will be material from soft acrobatics, hand balancing, aerials, floor work and other disciplines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All bodies, skill and experience levels welcome.

                    The exploration and practice of improvisational movement trains fun, fitness, attention and somatic awareness. Itâ€™s a valuable tool to accelerate your learning and mastery of other movement (& non-movement) disciplines. Improvisation is also a powerful tool for developing self practices you love and that serve your long- and short-term artistic, health and longevity goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this class we practice listening deeply to our bodies and to the underlying movement patterns themselves in order to discover and unleash spontaneity, power and flow.
