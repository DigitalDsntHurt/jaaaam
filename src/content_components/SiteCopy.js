                We treat our bodies badly. Or we ignore them. We keep still and quiet. We eat and move with shame. We are embarrassed to drag this flesh suit around behind us as we walk through life.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's not our fault. It's a byproduct of living in a world that admires a narrow set of ideals and people. For instance: nearly all the "exercise", "fitness", "training" you've come across in your life is modeled on one of three fantasies: (1) The Olympian (2) The Soldier (3) The Ballerina.
            </p>
            <p>
                But you don't need to be an Olympian, a soldier or a ballerina. You don't need to be muscular, limber or thin to be healthy. You don't need to model yourself on someone else's ideas of beauty, strength or freedom.
            </p>
            <p>
                Physical practices exist that will keep you safe, healthy and whole on your own terms, without beating you over the head with arbitrary and unfair ideals.

                Hi, I'm Nick.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm a movement teacher in the Dogpatch neighborhood of San Francisco. I focus on movement and awareness practices that are fun, caring, kind, gentle and (if you're into this kind of thing) wild.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was born and grew up in San Francisco (Upper Haight) and currently I'm obsessed with SF- and neighborhood-level community and community movement practices. In previous lives I've been a founder, sofware engineer, product manager, urban farmer, data-driven sports gambler and journalist. What unites these? A curious desire to solve problems in elegant and funny ways.

        <h3>What are Community Classes?</h3>
        <p>
            Free / donation-based classes in public spaces.
        </p>
        <p>
            These Community Classes aim to introduce people to Holistic Movement and to build and strengthen bonds within neighborhoods and between neighbors. While Holistic Movement is about connecting to your own body and heart, Community Classes are a way of connecting to a sense of place.
        </p>

        <h3>What is Holistic Movement?</h3>
        <p>
            Holistic Movement is a physical movement practice that prioritizes embodied attention over external form.
        </p>
        <p>
            Holistic Movement is inquiry-based, listening-based and uses the body to heal and grow physically, emotionally and spiritually.
        </p>
        <p>
            This practice is interested in sacredness, silliness meet and aims to make everything we do comfortable for all bodies, hearts and minds.
        </p>

        <h3>What to expect at a Community Class?</h3>
        <p>Community classes take many forms and as a facilitator I aim to be as sensitive to the real-time needs of participants as the practice encourages participants to be to their own needs.</p>
        <li>Many sessions start with a mindfulness prompt (for example: listen to the sound scape, move your hands apart during exhale and closer together during inhale).</li>
        <li>Many sessions include a guided, exploratory movement flow (for example: research ways of getting up and down from the earth, explore walking with flowing arms, examine movements of the neck).</li>
        <li>Many sessions include movement games, often a gentle relational game or an object manipulation game (for example: follow a partner's hand with your nose, balance an object on various body parts).</li>
        <li>Many sessions include learning a specific movement pattern and then blossoming that pattern into larger flows or related functional patterns we can incorporate into our daily lives.</li>
        <p>In all cases we explore physical form with the intention of fostering curious inquiry and making decisions that work for our attention and for our bodies.</p>
        <p>As a facilitator, I bring both injury and trauma informed approaches to the material.</p>

        <p>I'm Nick. I facilitate Holistic Movement classes, workshops and events in the Bay Area and throughout North America.</p>
        <p>My offerings are based on deep, long-term personal practice of somatic movement, contact improvisation and mindfulness meditation.</p>
        <p>My core curiosities are about movement and awareness practices that are fun, caring, kind, gentle and (if you're into this kind of thing) wild.</p>
        <p>I was born and grew up in San Francisco and my work draws on many disciplines but the emphasis and primary interests are always community, healing and how we relate to our own attention.</p>
