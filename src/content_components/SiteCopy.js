            <p>
                We treat our bodies badly. Or we ignore them. We keep still and quiet. We eat and move with shame. We are embarrassed to drag this flesh suit around behind us as we walk through life.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's not our fault. It's a byproduct of living in a world that admires a narrow set of ideals and people. For instance: nearly all the "exercise", "fitness", "training" you've come across in your life is modeled on one of three fantasies: (1) The Olympian (2) The Soldier (3) The Ballerina.
            </p>
            <p>
                But you don't need to be an Olympian, a soldier or a ballerina. You don't need to be muscular, limber or thin to be healthy. You don't need to model yourself on someone else's ideas of beauty, strength or freedom.
            </p>
            <p>
                Physical practices exist that will keep you safe, healthy and whole on your own terms, without beating you over the head with arbitrary and unfair ideals.

                Hi, I'm Nick.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm a movement teacher in the Dogpatch neighborhood of San Francisco. I focus on movement and awareness practices that are fun, caring, kind, gentle and (if you're into this kind of thing) wild.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was born and grew up in San Francisco (Upper Haight) and currently I'm obsessed with SF- and neighborhood-level community and community movement practices. In previous lives I've been a founder, sofware engineer, product manager, urban farmer, data-driven sports gambler and journalist. What unites these? A curious desire to solve problems in elegant and funny ways.
            </p>
            <p>

        <h3>What are Community Classes?</h3>
        <p>
            Free / donation-based classes in public spaces for movers of all ages, skill levels and body types.
        </p>
        <p>These Community Classes aim to introduce Holistic Movement and to build and strengthen neighborhood community. While Holistic Movement is about connecting to your own body and heart, Community Classes are a way of connecting to a sense of place.</p>
        <p>Community classes take many forms and as a facilitator I aim to be sensitive to the real-time needs of participants. Many sessions include:</p>
        <li>Mindfulness prompts (ex: listen to the sound scape, move hands apart during exhale, closer during inhale).</li>
        <li>Guided, exploratory movement flows (ex: research ways of getting up and down from the earth).</li>
        <li>Movement games (ex: follow a partner's hand with your nose, balance an object on various body parts).</li>
        <li>Movement patterns that blossom into larger flows or related functional patterns.</li>
        <p>In all cases we explore physical form with curiosity and make decisions that work for our attention and for our bodies.</p>
        <p>As a facilitator, I bring both injury and trauma informed approaches to the material.</p>

        <h3>What is Holistic Movement?</h3>
        <p>
            Holistic Movement is a physical movement practice that prioritizes embodied attention over external form.
        </p>
        <p>
            Holistic Movement is inquiry-based, listening-based and uses the body to heal and grow physically, emotionally and spiritually.
        </p>
        <p>
            This practice is interested in sacredness, silliness and aims to make everything we do comfortable for all bodies, hearts and minds.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In this class, we treat movement fluidity as a learnable skill and explore how we can move efficiently, safely and beautifully over the course of a long life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fluid movement can help us learn faster, exert less, prevent and recover from injury, have more fun and impress our friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will learn what fluid, efficient movement is and how to practice it by studying four structural elements:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <li>Our relationship with the ground and with gravity</li>
                    <li>A balanced pelvis</li>
                    <li>An available spine</li>
                    <li>A floating head</li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    There will be material from soft acrobatics, hand balancing, aerials, floor work and other disciplines.
                </p>

                    The exploration and practice of improvisational movement trains fun, fitness, attention and somatic awareness. It’s a valuable tool to accelerate your learning and mastery of other movement (& non-movement) disciplines. Improvisation is also a powerful tool for developing self practices you love and that serve your long- and short-term artistic, health and longevity goals.

                    Dance Lovers is an annual performance event held in San Francisco around Valentine’s Day. Bear Graham produces and curates DANCE LOVERS…duets by couples, crushes, and comrades. Graham invites artists with diverse pairings (friends, lovers, family members) to present duets in their unique styles/genres. The event began in 2011 at what was then called Kunst-Stoff Arts, and has also been presented at CounterPULSE and the Joe Goode Annex (our current “home”).
