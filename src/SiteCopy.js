        <p>
            We treat our bodies badly. Or we ignore them. We keep still and quiet. We eat and move with shame. We are embarrassed to drag this flesh suit around behind us as we walk through life.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's not our fault. It's a byproduct of living in a world that admires a narrow set of ideals and people. Think about this: nearly all the "exercise", "fitness", "training" you've come across in your life is modeled on one of three fantasies: (1) The Olympian (2) The Soldier (3) The Ballerina.
        </p>
        <p>
            But you don't need to be an Olympian, a soldier or a ballerina. You don't need to be muscular, limber or thin to be healthy. You don't need to model yourself on someone else's ideas of beauty, strength or freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
            Physical practices exist that will keep you safe, healthy and whole on your own terms, without beating you over the head with arbitrary and unfair ideals.

            Explore a practice that expresses curiosity and caring - for yourself and for the people and things around you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Discover a practice that encourages intuitive movement in the moment instead of along pre-determined pathways.

            Work with the material of the body to teach and learn about creativity, spontaneity, compassion and self love. We also do a lot of plain goofin' around.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of all, seek fun and pleasure. Not stories about fun and pleasure but the real thing. Felt by you in your body. <strong>It is possible to learn to move in a way that feels fun and pleasurable forever</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The practice draws inspiration from many disciplines including: Tai-Chi, Qigong, Yoga, Calisthenics, Somatics, The Feldenkrais Method, The Ido Portal Method, improvisational dance modalities, weight sharing games, mindfulness and many more beautiful movement communities and teachers around the world. But you don't need to worry about any of these if you don't want to.
