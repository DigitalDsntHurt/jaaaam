            We treat our bodies badly. We ignore them. We keep still and quiet. We eat and move with shame, with an embarrassment we have to drag this dying flesh around behind us as we navigate the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's not our fault. It's a byproduct of living in a culture that admires a narrow set of ideals and people. Think about this: nearly all the "exercise", "fitness", "training" you've come across in your life is modeled on one of three fantasies: (1) The Olympian (2) The Soldier (3) The Ballerina.
        </p>
        <p>
            But you don't need to be an Olympian, a soldier or a ballerina. You don't need to be muscular, limber or thin to be healthy. You don't need to want to model yourself on someone else's ideas of beauty, strength or freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
            Physical practices exist that will keep you safe, healthy and whole on your own terms, without beating you over the head with thoughtless admiration ideals.
