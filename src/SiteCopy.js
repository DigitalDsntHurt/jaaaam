            We treat our bodies badly. Or we ignore them. We keep still and quiet. We eat and move with shame. We are embarrassed to drag this flesh suit around behind us as we walk through life.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's not our fault. It's a byproduct of living in a world that admires a narrow set of ideals and people. Think about this: nearly all the "exercise", "fitness", "training" you've come across in your life is modeled on one of three fantasies: (1) The Olympian (2) The Soldier (3) The Ballerina.
        </p>
        <p>
            But you don't need to be an Olympian, a soldier or a ballerina. You don't need to be muscular, limber or thin to be healthy. You don't need to model yourself on someone else's ideas of beauty, strength or freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
            Physical practices exist that will keep you safe, healthy and whole on your own terms, without beating you over the head with arbitrary and unfair ideals.

            Seek curiosity and caring, spontaneity, creativity and compassion through movement. Most of all, seek fun and pleasure. Not stories about fun and pleasure but the real thing. Felt by you in your body.

            Hi, I'm Nick.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm a movement teacher in the Dogpatch neighborhood of San Francisco. I focus on movement and awareness practices that are fun, caring, kind, gentle and (if you're into this kind of thing) wild.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was born and grew up in San Francisco (Upper Haight) and currently I'm obsessed with SF- and neighborhood-level community and community movement practices. In previous lives I've been a founder, sofware engineer, product manager, urban farmer, data-driven sports gambler and journalist. What unites these? A curious desire to solve problems in elegant and funny ways.
        </p>
